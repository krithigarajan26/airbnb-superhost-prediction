# Airbnb Superhost Prediction

This project aims to predict whether an Airbnb host will achieve Superhost status based on various features and metrics. The analysis is focused on Airbnb listings in Chicago, utilizing machine learning techniques to identify key factors that contribute to Superhost status.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings in Chicago to:
- Identify key factors that influence Superhost status
- Build predictive models to determine Superhost likelihood
- Provide insights for hosts to improve their chances of becoming Superhosts

## Dataset

The dataset (`airbnb_Chicago.csv`) contains information about Airbnb listings in Chicago, including:
- Host information and metrics
- Property characteristics
- Review statistics
- Booking data
- Geographic and demographic information
- Historical performance metrics
